      <h1>Re:Eileen Dover University Application</h1>
   <p>Dear Elieen,

      Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part 
      of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one in the following sections.
      <h2>Starting dates</h2>
      We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,however it would suit us better if you
      could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:   
      <ul style="line-height: 50%; "> <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"> <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
                         <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
                         <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li></ul></ul>     
      Please let me know if this is ok,and if so which start date you prefer

      you can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a> on your websites.
      <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
      At the Awesome Science faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall
      somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent,dedicated researcher,and just
      the kind of person we'd like to have on our time.Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
      by are as follows, in order of priority:
      <ol style="line-height: 50%;"><ol><li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine,and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of  funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F),when the
             &nbsp;
audience size exponetially increases(effect of 3X10<sup>3</sup> increasing to  3X10<sup>4</sup>. )</li>
        <li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores</li></ol></ol>
      So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd except the
      research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know?Thanks.
      <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
      Yes, you are right! As part of my post-decorate work, I <span style="font-style: italic;">did</span>study exotic tribal dances.To answer your question,
      my favorite dances are as follows with definitions;
      
      Polynesian chicken dance
                A little know but <span style="font-style: italic;">very</span> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around
                in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
      Icelandic brownian shuffle
                Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,they used to practice this dance,which
                involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
                tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired
                modern style such as Twerking.
      Arctic robot dance
                An interesting example of historic misinformation,English explores in the 1960s believed to have
                discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic",stilted movements,being practiced by inhabitant
                of Northern Alaska and Canada.Letter on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this 
                because they were really cold.
